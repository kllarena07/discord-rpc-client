# README

This project was vibe-coded using the Warp terminal as a way to reverse-engineer the Discord RPC protocol so that I could make an application that would allow me to set a custom Rich Presence.

While there was some basic research behind this project, all of the coding was done by the Warp terminal itself. However, I did dig around and consult the following resources:

- [Discord-CustomRP GitHub Repo](https://github.com/maximmax42/Discord-CustomRP/tree/master)

These resources helped me understand that Discord listens on port 6463 for RPC connections. I then used the Warp terminal itself to help me understand how to communicate with Discord's RPC server and how to set custom Rich Presence information.
